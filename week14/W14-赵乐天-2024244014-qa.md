**Q01: Brute Force algorithm**

- **prompt**:

  ```markdown
  What is the time complexity of the Brute Force algorithm, and why is it so high in the worst case?
  ```

- **model_name**:  **GPT-4-turbo**

- **model_version**: **v2**

- **response**:

  ```markdown
  The time complexity of the Brute Force algorithm is `O(m⋅n)`, where `m` is the length of the pattern and `n` is the length of the text. In the worst case, the algorithm must compare the pattern with the text starting at every possible position, leading to a high number of character comparisons, particularly when the text and pattern contain many repetitive characters.
  
  ```

**Q02: Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm **

- **prompt**:

  ```markdown
  Your answer is correct. Next question is that how does the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm avoid backtracking in the text, achieving linear time complexity?
  ```

- **model_name**:  **GPT-4-turbo**

- **model_version**: **v2**

- **response**:

  ```markdown
  The KMP algorithm avoids backtracking by precomputing a prefix function (also known as the "failure function"), which indicates the length of the longest proper prefix of the pattern that is also a suffix. When a mismatch occurs, the algorithm uses the prefix function to determine how far the pattern can be shifted without rechecking previously matched characters. This eliminates redundant comparisons and ensures the algorithm processes each character of the text only once, achieving 
  `O(n+m)` time complexity.
  ```

**Q03: Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm **

- **prompt**:

  ```markdown
  Your answer is correct. Next question about KMP is that what is the role of the prefix function in the KMP algorithm, and why is a fallback step necessary during its construction?
  ```

- **model_name**:  **GPT-4-turbo**

- **model_version**: **v2**

- **response**:

  ```markdown
  The prefix function encapsulates information about the pattern's self-overlapping structure, helping to determine the next possible starting position of the pattern after a mismatch. During its construction, fallback steps are necessary when a mismatch is encountered. These steps involve "falling back" to the next possible prefix length, using previously computed prefix function values. This ensures the prefix function accounts for all possible alignments efficiently without unnecessary comparisons.
  ```
  
  

**Q04: Finite State Automaton (FSA) **

- **prompt**:

  ```markdown
  Your answer is correct. Next question about FSA is that how does a Finite State Automaton (FSA) optimize matching efficiency in string matching?
  ```

- **model_name**:  **GPT-4-turbo**

- **model_version**: **v2**

- **response**:

  ```markdown
  An FSA optimizes matching by modeling the pattern as a state machine, where each state represents a prefix of the pattern. Transitions between states occur based on input characters. The FSA precomputes a transition function that defines the next state for each character at every state. During string matching, each character of the text is processed exactly once, and the automaton moves through states accordingly. If the accepting state is reached, a match is found. This eliminates the need for backtracking and ensures `O(n)` matching time.
  
  
  ```

**Q05:  new string-matching algorithm**

- **prompt**

  ```markdown
  With advancements in computational power and deep learning, could a new string-matching algorithm outperform traditional methods like KMP or suffix trees? If so, what principles might it use?
  ```

- **model_name**:  **GPT-4-turbo**

- **model_version**: **v2**

- **response**:

  ```markdown
  It is conceivable that future advancements in computational power and deep learning could lead to novel string-matching algorithms. Such algorithms might leverage neural networks to model patterns and text as embeddings in high-dimensional spaces, enabling approximate or exact matching through vector similarity measures. These methods could integrate reinforcement learning to optimize matching strategies dynamically. Additionally, quantum computing may introduce paradigms like Grover's algorithm, which could theoretically reduce the complexity of searching unsorted data. However, practical implementation and efficiency in real-world scenarios remain active areas of research.
